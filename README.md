# Time-s-Up
__Time's Up__ is a race against time to score the maximum points before the timer runs out. The project is made on Unity Editor version 2019.4.16f1 and includes Windows Build. To open the application, navigate to _Builds â†’ Time'sUp.exe._

## How to Play
Initially, the timer is set at 15 seconds. The game includes spawning cubes which add/deduct the time. Simply move the crosshairs, aim at a cube, and __SHOOT__! <br>

There are 3 types of cubes to shoot at:
- __Green Cube__ - Adds 5 points to the score.
- __Red Cube__ - Deducts 3 seconds from the current time. _Has no effect on the score._
- __Yellow Cube__ - Bonus cube that adds 3 seconds to the current time. _Has no effect on the score._ 

After the timer runs out, __shoot__ on the _Play Again_ button to restart the game.

### Controls
- Player movement can be controlled using either the arrow keys or the WSAD keys.
- Move the crosshairs using touchpad.
- Shoot using the _Left Mouse Button_.

If you play the game in the Unity editor, the cursor disappears as soon as the Play button is hit. To get it back, press the _Escape (Esc)_ key.

## CHALLENGE
My high score is __560 points__. Anybody out there who can beat this? xD
